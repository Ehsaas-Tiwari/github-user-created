# GitHub User Info FetcherApplication OverviewThis single-file web application allows you to fetch and display the account creation date for any GitHub username. It's built with modern web standards, uses Tailwind CSS for a fully responsive design, and supports optional GitHub Personal Access Tokens for potentially higher rate limits or private repository access (though this app only fetches public user info).## Features- **GitHub User Lookup**: Easily find when a GitHub account was created.- **Optional Authentication**: Supports `?token=` query parameter for including a GitHub Personal Access Token.- **Responsive Design**: Adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes using Tailwind CSS.- **Simple Interface**: A clean and intuitive user experience.- **Single-File Deployment**: All HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are contained within a single `index.html` file, making it incredibly easy to deploy.## Technologies Used- **HTML5**: For the basic structure of the web page.- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and responsive UI development.- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For fetching data from the GitHub API and manipulating the DOM.## Getting Started### PrerequisitesNone! You just need a modern web browser.### Installation and Usage1.  **Save the file**: Save the provided `index.html` content into a file named `index.html` on your local machine.2.  **Open in Browser**: Open `index.html` with your web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).3.  **Enter Username**: Type a GitHub username into the input field.4.  **Get Creation Date**: Click the "Get Creation Date" button. The creation date will appear below the form.### Using a GitHub Personal Access Token (Optional)If you want to use a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) for authenticated requests (which can help with rate limits, although for public user info, it's often not strictly necessary), you can append it to the URL as a query parameter.1.  **Generate a PAT**: Go to GitHub Settings -> Developer settings -> Personal access tokens. Generate a new token. For this application, no specific scopes are strictly required as we're fetching public user data, but `public_repo` (if fetching other data) or `user` could be relevant for more advanced usage.2.  **Append to URL**: Open the `index.html` file in your browser and then add `?token=YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN` to the URL in the address bar.Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN` with your actual token.Example: `file:///path/to/your/index.html?token=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`## Error Handling- If a username is not found, an appropriate error message will be displayed.- Network errors or issues with the GitHub API will also be caught and displayed.## Development- The application is a single HTML file. You can open it directly in a browser to run it.- All styling is handled via the Tailwind CSS CDN, and all JavaScript is embedded directly in a `<script>` tag.## LicenseThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the [LICENSE](#license) file for details.## ContributingFeel free to fork the repository (if this were a repository) and submit pull requests with improvements or bug fixes.
