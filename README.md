# GitHub User Lookup Application (Round 2 Update) This project is a simple web application that allows users to look up GitHub user profiles. It fetches user data from the GitHub API and displays key information such as avatar, name, bio, follower/following counts, public repositories, and account creation age. This version includes new features like an `aria-live` alert for status updates, calculation of account age, and `localStorage` caching for improved performance. ## Features - **GitHub User Search**: Enter a username to fetch and display their profile. - **Responsive Design**: Built with Tailwind CSS for a mobile-first, responsive user experience. - **`aria-live` Status Alerts**: Provides real-time feedback to users (especially assistive technologies) on loading, success, or error states using an `aria-live` region (`#github-status`). - **Account Age Display**: Calculates and displays the user's GitHub account age in years. - **Local Storage Caching**: Caches the last successful user lookup in `localStorage` under a key like `github-user-<username>` to reduce API calls and speed up subsequent lookups for the same user. ## Technologies Used - **HTML5**: For the basic structure of the web page. - **Tailwind CSS**: For utility-first styling and responsive design. - **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For fetching data from the GitHub API, DOM manipulation, and implementing caching logic. ## How to Use 1.  **Open `index.html`**: Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. 2.  **Enter Username**: Type a GitHub username into the input field. 3.  **Search**: Click the "Search" button or press `Enter`. 4.  **View Profile**: The application will display the user's profile information, including their avatar, name, login, bio, follower/following/repo counts, and account age. Status messages will appear above the profile card. If you search for the same user again, the data might load faster from your browser's local storage. ## Local Development To run this project locally: 1.  **Clone the repository** (if this were a Git project). 2.  **Navigate to the project directory**. 3.  **Open `index.html`** in your preferred web browser. No special build steps or server are required as it's a single-file HTML application. ## Project Structure - `index.html`: The main and only file containing all the HTML structure, Tailwind CSS links, and JavaScript logic. - `README.md`: This file, providing information about the project. - `LICENSE`: The MIT License for the project. ## Accessibility Notes - The `#github-status` element uses `role="status"` and `aria-live="polite"` to ensure screen readers announce dynamic status updates without interrupting the user. - Semantic HTML elements are used where appropriate. ## Contributing This is a self-contained demonstration project.
